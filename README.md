# La Rollingneta
Final project of the course I did in RollingCode, developed with React.js and Node.js. It's a news web-site developed with my work team, which is not insignificant, as it taught me how to work effectively as part of a team, with all that it entails: getting rich from other contributions, giving a hand to a colleague who needs it, compromising personal preferences to maintain team harmony, etc. The administrator can: CRUD (news and users) and highlight news. Users can like the news, which are stored in a cart.

## Team members:
 
- Ter√°n Francisco 
- Bianconi Marina
- Hongn Andrea
